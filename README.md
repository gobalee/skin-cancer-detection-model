# Skin Cancer Prediction Model
### Prepared by: Mohammad Ali

>This repository contains the implementation of a skin cancer prediction model using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify images of skin lesions as either benign or malignant, aiding in the early detection of skin cancer.

## Introduction
Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving the chances of successful treatment. This project aims to leverage the power of machine learning to assist medical professionals in diagnosing skin cancer more accurately and efficiently.

The skin cancer prediction model is trained on a diverse dataset of skin lesion images, and it can classify new images into two categories: benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous). By providing a prediction based on image analysis, this model can serve as a valuable tool in a dermatologist's toolkit.

## Dataset
The dataset used to train and evaluate the model consists of a large collection of skin lesion images with corresponding labels indicating whether each lesion is benign or malignant. The dataset is sourced from reputable medical databases and is preprocessed to ensure data quality.

## Model Architecture
The skin cancer prediction model is built using a deep neural network architecture that takes skin lesion images as input and outputs the predicted class. The architecture comprises several convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification. The model is trained using an appropriate loss function and optimizer.


Results
The performance of the skin cancer prediction model is evaluated on a separate test dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision are calculated to assess the model's effectiveness.
